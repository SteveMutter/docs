Autodarts.io is an DIY camera-based automatic scoring system for steel dart boards. 

It's designed to run on cost-effective hardware.
The software runs on most hardware, such as Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi 4, or Intel NUC, that are running Linux-based operating systems. 
There are also Windows and Mac builds in alpha release. At this stage of development, accuracies of up to 99% are possible. 

Basically all you need is 

> a standard dart board with a 360-degree LED ring light to eliminate shadows, 

> three USB cameras without lens distortion (which can be corrected through extra calibration setup), 

> a computing unit like Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi 4, Intel NUC or equivalent, 

> and a mounting solution to position the cameras around the 360 degrees.
