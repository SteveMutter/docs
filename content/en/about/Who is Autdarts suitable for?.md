Basically, autodarts is a system for anyone who enjoys playing darts.

At the moment, it is possible to play games such as X01, Cricket, Bermuda, Shanghai, Gotcha, ATC, ATW, Random Checkout, Count Up, and more. You can play by yourself, with friends, or against a bot, offering something for everyone. Since the project is a DIY system, don't be afraid to work on the hardware and software yourself. However, don't worry, we are constantly working on the documentation to make getting started as easy as possible. Additionally, our community is quite large and helpful when it comes to assisting new players.
